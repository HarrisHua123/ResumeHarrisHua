# [Personal Resume](https://baileystein.com/)

This is the repository for my online resume / website, which contains static content hosted with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The website's theme, [Resume](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/resume/), was originally created by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/). I have modified it to satisfy my preferences.
