            <h3 class="mb-0">Familarize myself with working in a professional IT environment</h3>
            <div>Learned how to work with the ServiceFirst ticketing system i.e. working with tickets and incidents. I feel quite comfortable working in a professional IT environment  now. Got positive feedback from my co-workers and supervisor about the work performed and learned a lot about the work flow in an office and also how to manage time effectively to perform all the required duties. Made sure to resolve a high number of incidents while making sure that the quality of work was at par with the company standards and can say without a doubt that I am more technologically literate now and have gained a lot of exposure in the IT field with this co-op position.</div>

            <div>Improved my written communication skills by making sure that my work notes were as descriptive as possible by documenting all the steps taken to resolve an incident in a clear and concise manner, updating knowledge articles where necessary and making new ones as well when encountering a new issue. Got regular positive feedback from my co-workers and supervisor about the same. Received feedback from users as well about how I was able to effectively explain technical terms in layman terms. Made it a point to do regular follow-ups with users and keeping them in the loop if resolution was taking time.</div>

            <div>Tried to break down and analyze every incident in order to pinpoint what the exact issue is and apply the appropriate fix rather than trying to fix every similar problem with the same steps. Rather than trying to fix an issue right away, now I always try to understand what the root cause is so as to make sure that the issue does not repeat itself. I also learned a great deal about the Window Operating System, working with regedit, command prompt and the Microsoft Office Suite. </div>

      <div class="w-100">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>This Co-op was my introduction with a professional IT environment so I had a great deal to learn and it has provided me with a solid foundation. I gained experience with troubleshooting and working around with the registry for the Microsoft Suite, Citrix, OneDrive Desktop Client, Maas360, ServiceFirst, NetVCR, ISE, SCEP as well as SCCM actions. To add, I have also sharpened my troubleshooting, communication, critical thinking and problem solving skills. This job has made me realize how important IT support is for the smooth operation of a company. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at The Co-operators.</p>
        <h2 style="color: #BD5D38">Academic Relation</h2>
        <p>This co-op work term has definitely enhanced my academic experience. Problem solving is the most key skill when it comes to the software courses I have at the University of Guelph and this job has taught me how to break down and analyze problems in order to pinpoint what the exact issue is i.e root-cause analysis and also to fix the issue at it's root so it does not repeat itself. Due to the varied nature of issues I had to work on, the job has conditioned me to look at each problem from a number of angles and also to think outside of the box. This job has also further strengthened my understanding of a computer's working by introducing me to the Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager and RegEdit.</p>
        <h2>Focus of the Report</h2>
        <p>The main focus of my work term was resolving incidents based on a ticketing system and the most important aspect of that was documentation. Throughout my academic courses, I have learned how important commenting is when writing code, and now I understood the real importance for that. Not only did I have to read the work notes that were entered before the issue was escalated to me but also carefully document every step I took in the troubleshooting process. Whenever a workaround or resolution for an issue was found, my responsibility was to create 'Knowledge Articles' that outlined the issue, the symptoms of the issue and the steps to be followed for it's resolution. These Knowldege Articles would be used by the IT Helpdesk so that the issue could be resolved in a timely manner without the need for escalation the next time it was encountered. I also had to create and/or update documentation for Technical Support staff when new hardware or software was introduced into the environment</p>
